# PlantPulse
This is a python based application which analyses plant health and reports its overall status with suggestions to improve. It does so with the help of data that it collects from the sensor. For the sake of this project ( atleast in the beginning), we will create fake data and ensure our model works and then test it with real sensors and data. 
We are using python, HTML, CSS and Javascript to make this into a functioning project , an app. We will also use python's modules such as Flask, matplotlib and openCV to make this into a smarter project. One that will be able to tell you what it is looking at , what kind of plant it is, what are conditions in which it is being grown, how that affects it, and hwo it can be optimised to improve the life and quality of the plant or of the soil.
Dataset: PlantVillage Dataset (download from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset)
Trained the model using Tensor flow to predict and analyze plant health and to suggest improvements by recognizing the plant type and keeping in mind the weather conditions of the region of which the photo was taken and uploaded.
