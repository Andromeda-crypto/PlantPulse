# PlantPulse
This is a python based application which analyses plant health and reports its overall status with suggestions to improve. It does so with the help of data that it collects from the sensor. For the sake of this project ( atleast in the beginning), we will create fake data and ensure our model works and then test it with real sensors and data.
